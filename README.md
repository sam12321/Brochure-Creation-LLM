📄 Brochure Creation Project
🔍 Overview

This project leverages OpenAI’s Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate unique, professional brochures for companies — given only their website URL.

By combining API calls with single-shot prompting techniques, the system extracts meaningful information about the company from its main webpage and related links. This ensures the brochure is:

Accurate

Concise

Tailored specifically to the company

✨ Features

🚀 Automated Content Extraction – Scrapes company details from the given URL and related pages.

🤖 LLM-Powered Summarization – Uses OpenAI’s API for high-quality, natural-language brochure text.

🎨 Custom Brochure Generation – Produces unique marketing content for each company.

🔄 Single-Shot Prompting – Ensures consistent, precise results without lengthy prompt chains.
